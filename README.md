# Food_Website
### This is the Food Website Task
### For the satff interface I have used the admin interface  of Django. The superuser is a staff.
### Create superuser using "python manage.py createsuperuser"
### As a staff one needs to add the items manually by going into the admin interface and the necessary model called Item has been created.
### One also needs to add the images to the respective food items manually. 
### I have used django_import_export for storing the data of the orders into an excel file for that enter "pip install django_import_export"
### As required in the task we had to send mail for promotions I had used it but left out here since we had  to include the Password for the mail.
### In the home page I have used random images and text for the display it implies nothing.
### After adding the items please go to menu tab to select items.
### Keeping all these in mind run "python manage.py runserver"
